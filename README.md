# Cheskers project

## Known issues

If there are two or more moves that start and end in the same place human players cant choose which of these moves they take

Humans also cant pick which piece their pawn is promoted to

The king cant do multiple hops, this kept causing bugs. Having the king only move one space is more like chess anyway

The board display gets buggy if you have two humans playing against each other
