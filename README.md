# Cheskers project

Presentation about the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zJ1B78ln2M)

## Running

**I couldnt upload the final executable to the honours project system so you'll have to clone the repo at https://github.com/wockradd/Cheskers to get it**

To run the program run ./Checkers.jar in a terminal. This jar was uploaded using git lfs so make sure you clone the repo correctly to run it.

A file 'moves.txt' will be generated after running. To quickly collect data use 'runalot.sh' run it multiple times.



## Known issues

The final executable cant load in the icons for the pieces correctly

If there are two or more moves that start and end in the same place human players cant choose which of these moves they take

Humans also cant pick which piece their pawn is promoted to

The king cant do multiple hops, this kept causing bugs. Having the king only move one space is more like chess anyway

The board display gets buggy if you have two humans playing against each other
